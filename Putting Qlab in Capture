So this was something I stumbled upon a few months back while messing about... But it worked quite well 

Software: 
= Caputure 
= OBS
= NDI Plug in https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi
= Qlab (Duh)

Hardware
= 2nd Monitor 
= a couple network cables
= an adaptor of some sort to network cable (everything is a dongle after 2013...) 
= Network switch 

So pretty much the idea is putting qlab playback in to capture, while working on a festival as AV tech we was working on hypertheticals. This was one of them 

Pretty much ( You will find I say that alot) 

OBS > Qlab output screen 
OBS > NDI > Capture

So this was a bit complicated but it worked well. 

From memory Capture needed to be on a similar range of IP address (/shug is what it is)

Set the NDI feed as a material and paste it on your wall your using. 

I mean I never said this was great but it certainly gives you a chance to pre vis stuff, then once you get in the venue all you have to do its projection map.
