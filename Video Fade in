I still dont know if I'm doing this wrong.... but sure lets go with it.

Create a video cue, in qlab. 
set the opacity to 0% 

Put a fade cue and link in to the video cue, fade up to 100% 

Put them both in a group, set the group to start all children simultaneously 

When fading the video file, fade the *Group* it works better.
